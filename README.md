# Python Games
A repository for basic games created to improve my skills in Python. All games are meant to be played in the command line interface.

## Tic Tac Toe
How to play: Take turns creating names for Player One and Player Two. Each player then takes turns entering a number 1 through 9 which will correspond with a labeled square on the square to place their marker. Game will terminate once a player places 3 markers in a row or all spaces are filled.
