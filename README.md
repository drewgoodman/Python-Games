# Python Games
A repository for basic games built from scratch to improve my skills in Python. All games are meant to be played in the command line interface.


## Guessing Game
How to play: A random integer between 1 and 99 will be generated. Play by inputting a guess into the console. The game will return whether the guess is too high or too low. Once the correct number is guessed, a final evaluation will print based on how many guesses the player needed to find the correct number.

## Hangman
How to play: Player One types out a word for Player Two to guess. Player Two may then guess letters, which will fill in the blanks if correct, or increment the hangman state if incorrect. Player Two may also guess a full word and win if correct. The game is over if Player Two makes 6 incorrect guesses of letters or words.

## Magic 8-Ball
How to play: Input a question and the Magic 8-Ball will return a random answer from a dictionary bank. Pressing Enter with no question input will close the game.

## Tic Tac Toe
How to play: Take turns creating names for Player One and Player Two. Each player then takes turns entering a number 1 through 9 which will correspond with a labeled square on the square to place their marker. Game will terminate once a player places 3 markers in a row or all spaces are filled.
