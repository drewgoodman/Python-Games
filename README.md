# Python Games
A repository for basic games built from scratch to improve my skills in Python. All games are meant to be played in the command line interface.

## Tic Tac Toe
How to play: Take turns creating names for Player One and Player Two. Each player then takes turns entering a number 1 through 9 which will correspond with a labeled square on the square to place their marker. Game will terminate once a player places 3 markers in a row or all spaces are filled.

## Hangman
How to play: Player One types out a word for Player Two to guess. Player Two may then guess letters, which will fill in the blanks if correct, or increment the hangman state if incorrect. Player Two may also guess a full word and win if correct. The game is over if Player Two makes 6 incorrect guesses of letters or words.
